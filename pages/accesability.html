        We make a checkbox that is hidden to mimic the function of a proper hamburger menu without using js. The label for attribute makes it so whenever you click on it's contents
         (meny text and icon) you interract with the checkbox -->
      <input type="checkbox" id="check" aria-label="Toggle menu" tabindex="0">

      <p><a class="aAccessability" href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2017-06-16-51">Accessability is mandated by
          law in Norway.</a>
        As such there are certain standards that needs to be upheld for our page design. Currently lighthouse seems to
        think our site is upholding accessability standards quite well.</p>
      <img class="picturesPagesSmaller" src="../media/accessability-lighthouse.webp"
        alt="A picture of a lighthouse accessability test">
      <h2>What steps we've taken to address accesability on our site</h2>
      <p>While designing our website we've had a few key things in mind while designing. First and foremost we tried to
        use appropriate semantic elements wherever possible. We also made sure that various assisstive technology can
        access the site. And also ensuring that content is appropriatly rendered for people with visual impairment.</p>
      <p>It's important that websites scale responsivly to different screensizes. Therefore we've added mediaqueries to
        the site for varying screen sizes.
        This way no matter what device or screen-size you access our page from the content will all display in a way
        that doesn't break the layout.
      </p>
      <h3>Semantic elements</h3>
      <p> Various tags have been applied, some examples of semantic elements we've used: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;,
        &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;section&gt;
        They help screenreaders navigate the page properly, giving valuable information on where and what the user is
        looking at. As such they played a part in making sure
        the content of our site is easily viewable in an understandable way for people using screenreaders.
      </p><img class="picturesPagesSmaller" src="../media/semantic-tag-example.webp"
        alt="A picture showcasing the use of semantic tags in html">
      <p>We've also made efforts to have heading elements (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; etc.) be used in an descending manner.
        This again helps screenreaders navigate properly.</p>
      <p>Additionally we've put alt text on all images so that people with images disabled, or people using
        screenreaders can still browse our site without losing context.

      <h3>Helping assistive technology function</h3>
      <p>We've added some keyboard navigation functionality for our hamburger menu.
        Tabindexes make it possible to navigate to elements of the page that traditional html language might not allow
        you to use tab to access.</p>
      <p>We've also put ARIA properties to these elements so that assistive technology can properly parse and see what
        it's looking at.</p>

      <h3>Helping the visually impaired</h3>
      <img src="../media/high-contrast-text-color.webp" alt="Picture of text on a high contrast background.">
      <h3></h3>
      <p>Color contrast has been attempted to be kept high, to decrease the likelyhood that users will struggle to make
        out content.
        This is especially important for users with visual impairments.</p>
      <p>Since we've included a video on our Mathemical modelling page, it should have transcription. This is to ensure
        that people with hearing difficulties can still access content.
        If you're hard of hearing or deaf video content can be rendered completely useless without captions, transcripts
        or audio descriptions.
      </p>
